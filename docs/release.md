# Releasing USA — operations runbook

The release pipeline is fully automated. Normal operation requires nothing
beyond merging PRs. This file exists so future-you (or a successor) can
reconstruct _why_ every piece is shaped the way it is, and what to do when
something breaks. It is the durable memory of the sessions that built it.

## The chain (normal operation — nothing to do)

```
conventional commit on master
        │  feat → minor · fix → patch · BREAKING CHANGE → major
        │  (docs/chore/test ride along without bumping)
        ▼
release-please opens/updates ONE Release PR
  (version bump + CHANGELOG entries as a reviewable diff)
        │  human merges it  ← the only manual step, and it is code review
        ▼
tag vX.Y.Z cut automatically
        ▼
release.yml publishes: OIDC → npmjs (+ provenance + SBOM artifact),
then mirrors the same tarball to GitHub Packages (repo Packages tab)
```

What you do: write conventional titles, review PRs, merge the Release PR.
Everything else — bump arithmetic, CHANGELOG entries, tags, publishing,
provenance, SBOM — happens on its own.

## One-time setups (done — do not redo unless broken)

| #   | Setup                                                         | Where / state                                              |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Package exists on npmjs as `@xenos1996/usa` (scoped: the      | Created by a one-time manual publish of 2.0.1 (see below). |
|     | bare name `usa` is blocked by the typosquat filter)           | Never republish a version.                                 |
| 2   | OIDC trusted publisher (org `Er-Sajan-PLG`, repo              | Package page → Settings → Trusted Publisher.               |
|     | `universal-software-auditor`, workflow `release.yml`, no env) | Exact basename — full paths do not match.                  |
| 3   | Trusted publisher may **publish directly**                    | Same page (checkbox). Without it, PUTs 404.                |
| 4   | Publishing access: strictest (2FA required, no bypass tokens) | Same page. OIDC works with either option.                  |
| 5   | `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`: fine-grained PAT, this repo only —    | Repo Settings → Secrets → Actions. **Check its expiry**    |
|     | Contents + PRs + Issues read+write                            | (Settings → Developer settings → Tokens): when it lapses,  |
|     |                                                               | Release PRs silently stop appearing. Rotate yearly.        |

The bootstrap token used for the first manual publish is deleted. No
static credential that can publish exists anymore — only OIDC (CI) and
2FA (humans).

### Bootstrapping a brand-new package name (the chicken-and-egg)

OIDC trusted publishing **cannot create a package that does not exist
yet** — the very first PUT 404s (`404 Not Found - PUT …/@scope%2fname`),
while the tarball itself builds and signs provenance fine. npm only
accepts the OIDC flow once the package exists _and_ its Trusted
Publisher is configured. So the first publish of a new name is manual:

```bash
# from a clean checkout of the tag you intend to ship
git checkout v2.0.1 && npm ci && npm run build
npm login                              # owner account, 2FA
npm publish --access public            # creates the package (manual, once)
npm view @xenos1996/usa version        # → 2.0.1
```

Then, while logged in on npmjs.com: **Package → Settings → Trusted
Publisher → GitHub Actions**, org `Er-Sajan-PLG`, repo
`universal-software-auditor`, workflow `release.yml`, and tick _allow
publish directly_. From that point on, tags publish themselves; re-run
the failed Release run to confirm. This was done for the `usat → usa`
rename: `usat` got the same treatment at 1.0.0.

**Reading the re-run correctly.** Once the Trusted Publisher is wired,
re-running a tag whose version is already on the registry fails with
`You cannot publish over the previously published versions: X.Y.Z` — that
is the fix working, not a regression: OIDC authenticated and the registry
recognised the package, it simply refuses the duplicate. The definitive
green is the **next** new version: it publishes with no manual step. Do
not "fix" the duplicate-version error; it is the fail-closed contract.

## Recurring (calendar, not automation)

- **PAT expiry** — the one thing that silently breaks releases. Check the
  date when the reminder fires; generate a replacement with identical
  scope, swap the secret, delete the old token.
- **First-run review of each Release PR** — read the CHANGELOG diff;
  release-please derives it from titles, so a sloppy title ships a sloppy
  note. Fix by amending the title before merge (it recalculates).
- **Scorecard / Security tab** — glance monthly; the workflow already runs.

## Manual fallback

If automation ever wedges: Actions → **Release** → Run workflow (on
`master`) publishes whatever `package.json` holds. Safe to re-run — a
duplicate version fails closed at the registry with nothing mutated.
Never push `v*` tags by hand; the tag is the release act and belongs to
release-please (bootstrap tag `v1.0.0` excepted).

## Verifying a signed report (verify-only)

A rendered report can ship with an optional detached signature sidecar
(`AUDIT.md.sig.json`) as supply-chain-grade evidence that the bytes being
read are the bytes that were audited. USA only **verifies** such sidecars —
it never mints them.

**Minting is blocked.** The charter constraint behind ADR-0011 says USA has
no signer, so adding a sign capability would re-open ADR-0011 first — which
has not happened. Until such an amendment lands, signatures are produced
outside USA with stock Sigstore tooling, and USA only checks them. There is
deliberately no `sign` function, no CLI flag, and no key handling in the
codebase; the verify-side module is `src/report/signature.ts`.

How it fits together:

1. The signed payload is the report's canonical trailer bytes — the same
   machine-readable trailer `usa diff` already parses, so a signature binds
   exactly what a diff compares. No second canonicalization exists.
2. Whoever holds the signing key signs that payload externally:
   `cosign sign-blob --key key.pem --bundle report.bundle --yes AUDIT.md`
   (key management stays entirely outside USA).
3. The bundle is stored beside the report as `AUDIT.md.sig.json`, holding
   the payload hash plus the base64-encoded bundle.
4. Verification replays the check with the public key:
   `cosign verify-blob --key key.pub --bundle report.bundle AUDIT.md`,
   or programmatically through `verifyDetachedSignature()` in
   `src/report/signature.ts`, which performs the same subprocess call after
   first comparing the sidecar's bound hash.

Fail-closed contract (mirrors `command` checks): a tampered payload fails,
a missing key fails, a cosign rejection fails — and when the `cosign`
binary itself is absent, verification throws an explicit error instead of
passing. An unverifiable report is never reported as verified.

## Decisions with permanent consequences

- **No moving `v1` tag.** It would retrigger `release.yml` (`v*` matches)
  and fail on the duplicate version. Docs pin exact versions instead.
- **No semantic-release.** Rule-pack content keeps its human gate; fully
  automatic publishing is the wrong risk profile here (see ROADMAP.md).
- **npmjs is the source of truth; GitHub Packages is a mirror.** Old
  versions were never backfilled to GPR — two sources of truth for dead
  versions is worse than a thin Packages tab for one cycle.
