# Getting started

## Install

```bash
npx @xenos1996/usa audit .          # zero-install
npm i -g @xenos1996/usa             # or globally
npm i -D @xenos1996/usa             # or per project, so CI and laptops agree
```

Requires Node 20+. No network access is needed at audit time, and USA never
uploads anything — it reads files and writes one report (Markdown by default;
JSON or SARIF via `--format`).

## Your first audit

```bash
cd ~/code/my-project
usa detect .     # 1. check what it thinks you are
usa audit .      # 2. audit it
open AUDIT.md
```

Start with `detect`. If the detected facts are wrong, the report will be wrong —
and fixing it takes one line of config:

```yaml
# .usa.yaml
facts: ['has:database'] # assert anything detection missed
```

## Declare your foundation

Before the first full audit, record what the project is for — see
[Foundation readiness](foundation.md). The interview takes a few minutes and
produces `.usa/foundation.yaml` (vision, intents, per-pillar evidence); the
report then grades each pillar as READY, PARTIAL, or MISSING next to the rule
findings. Skip it and the audit still runs — it just grades the code without
knowing what the code is for.

## Reading the report

**1 · Look at the band, not the number.**

```
Overall Health Score: 71.4/100
Expected band for Beta / Growing: 60–85 — within the expected band 👍
```

A 55/100 on a prototype is healthy. The same 55/100 on a production service is a
problem. USA tells you which you are looking at.

**2 · Read Immediate Action Required.** CRITICAL and security-HIGH findings, with
location and fix. Everything else waits.

**3 · Check confidence before celebrating.**

| Dimension          | Score | Confidence |
| ------------------ | ----- | ---------- |
| S10 · Dependencies | 10/10 | 25%        |

A 10/10 at 25% confidence means one of four applicable rules could be checked
automatically. The other three are in the judgement queue. Sections where
_nothing_ could be verified say **"— not verified"** and are excluded from the
total rather than quietly scoring 10.

**4 · Work the judgement queue.** These are the checks grep cannot settle. Take them
to an agent or a reviewer. Every row says what to look for and what evidence to
record. **Do not mark anything ✅ without evidence.**

The queue is triaged: **⚙️ Assisted** items settle themselves once you enable
`--allow-commands` or commit the artifact they read — re-run instead of
reasoning. **🧠 Judgement** items need a person. Each row shows **Last
reviewed** from `.usa.yaml` `reviews:` so a confirmed item is recorded once
with its age, not re-litigated every run (ADR-0023).

**5 · Ship the roadmap.** SPRINT 0 → SPRINT 1 → SPRINT 2 → BACKLOG, generated from
severity. `DEFERRED` lists what the maturity profile says you should deliberately
ignore _at this stage_.

## Common flags

```bash
usa audit . --depth deep                 # include deep-only rules (cycles, duplication, complexity)
usa audit . --profile production         # grade against the full bar regardless of age
usa audit . --fail-on high               # exit 1 on HIGH+ (for CI gates)
usa audit . --out reports/2026-09.md     # dated reports, so you can diff them later
usa audit . --format narrative           # verdict-first story: foundation, fires, honest score
usa audit . --allow-commands             # run shell checks (npm audit, depcheck, dpdm)
usa audit . --include stacks/solidity    # force a pack on
usa rules --section S2                   # list rules
usa explain SEC-001                      # everything about one rule
```

`--allow-commands` is **off by default** because it shells out. Those rules appear
as ❓ NEEDS REVIEW until you enable it — which is the point: they are real checks,
they just need your permission to run.

## Compare two audits

```bash
usa audit . --out reports/2026-06.md
# ... three months of work ...
usa audit . --out reports/2026-09.md
usa diff reports/2026-06.md reports/2026-09.md
```

The diff reads the YAML trailer embedded in every report — so a Markdown report is
still the only artefact you need to keep. (If you also emit SARIF/JSON for
dashboards, the Markdown stays the human-readable source of truth.)

## Live session (conversational audit)

```bash
usa live . --transcript SESSION.md
```

Walks foundation → audit → triage → report with you, keeping a transcript.
With a provider configured (`--provider`, `--model`, or `USA_PROVIDER`), the
model turns converse; without one the session runs deterministically, saying
so loudly at every skipped turn. See [Agent integration](agent-integration.md)
for driving it with an agent, and `usa live --help` for flags.
