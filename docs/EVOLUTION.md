# Evolution loop

USA's autonomous improvement loop, implemented as a **deterministic, offline
pipeline** (see [ADR-0013](adr/0013-deterministic-evolution-loop.md)). No LLM,
no database, no network. The proof that "USA got better" is a before/after
measurement, not an assertion.

> This is the **automated** loop. For the human/agent-driven research process
> used on capability-stress experiments (the `experiments/` runs), see the
> [Experiment protocol](EXPERIMENT_PROTOCOL.md).

> Status legend used throughout: `[IMPLEMENTED]` / `[PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]` /
> `[PLANNED]` / `[DEFERRED]`.

## What is a capability here

For this milestone a **capability is a rule pack** (a `data` capability, per
ADR-0003). A _candidate_ capability is a pack that is not in `rules/index.yaml`.
A _released_ capability is injected into a re-audit through `runAudit`'s
`extraPacks` — the on-disk registry is never mutated.

## Modules and the core/platform split

- **Core (deterministic, offline, stateless):** `src/snapshot/`,
  `src/evolution/coverage.ts`, `src/evolution/gap.ts`,
  `src/evolution/capability.ts`, `src/evolution/release.ts`, plus the existing
  engine. These are pure functions of (snapshot, capability set, engine version).
- **Platform (stateful, still zero-dep):** `src/store/` (persistence) and
  `src/evolution/run.ts` (orchestration that records run/result identities).

## Reproducibility / provenance

An audit's reproducibility boundary is:

```
snapshotId  +  capabilitySetId  +  engineVersion  →  report (content-addressed)
```

`capabilitySetId` is a hash of (engine version, base pack ids, extra capability
id@version). The full `AuditReport` is stored content-addressed (`resultId`), so
a stored run can be reconstructed byte-for-byte.

## The proposal stage

`src/evolution/propose.ts` answers "where does a candidate come from?" **without
an LLM**. Two deterministic sources:

- **From a gap** — `proposeCandidate(gap)` renders the bootstrap starter pack for
  the gap's language (the same catalog `usa bootstrap` uses, the single source of
  truth) and parses it back into a `CandidateCapability` with status `PROPOSED`.
- **From learn suggestions** — `proposeFromSuggestions(suggestions)` turns the
  manual checks emitted by `usa learn` into a single `learn-proposals` candidate
  pack of `manual` checks. `manual` is the honest proposal when a missing check
  cannot yet be expressed as data.

Both are pure functions and both are **human-gated**: a proposal is unreviewed
and never reaches `rules/index.yaml`. It only becomes trusted after it clears the
benchmark fleet and the release gate (producer ≠ judge, per
[ADR-0014](adr/0014-proposal-stage-and-release-evidence.md)).

Enable it in the loop:

```bash
# propose from gaps, then benchmark/release the first proposable candidate
usa evolve /some/lua/repo --propose --bench-dir examples/evolution/bench
```

## Release requires evidence

`evaluateRelease` rejects a benchmark with **zero cases**. An unbenchmarked
candidate would otherwise score a vacuous precision/recall of 1.000 and sail
through the gate; requiring positive evidence keeps the "evidence over claims"
invariant (ADR-0014).

## The persistent gap queue

`src/evolution/queue.ts` is the durable memory of the loop. Every audit
re-discovers the same gaps; the queue answers "which gaps are open right now?"
across runs without ever mutating a record.

- Every state change is one **append-only** record in the Store, keyed by a
  `namespace` (default `gaps`). The latest state is a pure fold over the
  records — there is no mutable index that can drift, so replaying the store
  reproduces the queue exactly.
- `recordGaps` opens new gaps, re-opens previously closed ones, and treats an
  unchanged re-observation as `existing` (no duplicate transition). A change to
  the evidence trail is a genuine update and appends.
- When a candidate is **released**, the gap(s) it targeted are closed. The
  queue backing is enabled automatically whenever a `--store` is supplied (or
  explicitly with `persistGaps` in the programmatic API).

```bash
# run with persistence; the queue line reports open/closed/total
usa evolve /some/lua/repo --store /tmp/usa-store
```

## The queue-driven scheduler

`src/evolution/schedule.ts` is the unattended half of the loop. Where a normal
cycle evaluates **one** candidate, the scheduler walks **every** proposable
candidate (one per open gap, in priority order) through BENCHMARK → RELEASE and
closes the queue gap for each acceptance. It never proposes and never audits on
its own — it coordinates only the stages that already exist, so it cannot invent
work the proposal and gate steps would not have produced.

```bash
# evaluate every open gap in one deterministic run (opt-in)
usa evolve /some/multi-lang/repo --all-gaps --store /tmp/usa-store
```

The scheduler is **opt-in** (`--all-gaps` / `allGaps`); the default stays
single-candidate and backward compatible.

### The scheduler refuses vacuous releases

A gate `ACCEPT` only proves a candidate matches its fixtures. A capability whose
pack is **entirely `manual` checks** proves nothing automated: every `manual`
check reports `UNKNOWN`, so it trivially scores zero FP/FN and would pass a
vacuous benchmark. Releasing it would close a real gap with a capability that
detects nothing. The scheduler therefore rejects such a candidate even when the
gate accepts, with a `blockedReason` (ADR-0016). This is what makes the
auto-proposed bootstrap _fallbacks_ safe: they are surfaced as proposals, never
silently promoted to released capabilities.

## Learning a candidate from a report

`usa evolve --learn <report.md>` turns the open findings of a previously
generated report into a `learn-proposals` candidate of `manual` checks (via the
same `usa learn` machinery). It sits between an explicit `--candidate` and
`--propose` in precedence. A malformed or foreign report is refused with a
warning — never a crash — and the loop simply runs its BEFORE half.

```bash
usa audit /some/repo --out AUDIT.md
usa evolve /some/repo --learn AUDIT.md --min-severity LOW
```

## Worked example (end-to-end, runnable test)

The integration test `tests/e2e/evolution.test.ts` proves the loop on a Lua target —
a language USA detects but ships no pack for:

1. **BEFORE** — `lang:lua` is detected, coverage reports it unsupported, and a
   `CapabilityGap` (`unsupported-technology:lua`) is derived.
2. **CANDIDATE** — a `stacks/lua` pack (rule `LUA-001` flags `os.execute` /
   `loadstring` / `load`).
3. **BENCHMARK** — known-positive flags correctly, known-negative does not, and
   no existing rule regresses → precision 1.0, recall 1.0, 0 regressions.
4. **RELEASE** — deterministic gate returns `ACCEPT`.
5. **AFTER** — the same snapshot re-audited with the released capability: Lua is
   covered, `LUA-001` is now detectable (WRONG), the gap is closed, coverage rises.

Run it manually:

```bash
# deterministic BEFORE half
usa evolve /some/lua/repo

# full loop with a candidate pack + benchmark cases
usa evolve /some/lua/repo \
  --candidate examples/evolution/stacks-lua.yaml \
  --bench-dir examples/evolution/bench \
  --store /tmp/usa-store
```

## Deferred (deliberately, in this milestone)

- `[DEFERRED]` Dynamic/sandbox execution, model roles, discovery, scheduling,
  n8n, dashboards, PostgreSQL/NATS — none are needed to prove the feedback loop.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` The queue-driven scheduler (`--all-gaps`) evaluates every
  proposable candidate per run. A **background/daemon** mode that runs the
  scheduler on a timer with no operator is still `[DEFERRED]`.
- `[DEFERRED]` Model runtime (`ModelRuntime`, model bundle in provenance) — a
  later, optional layer; producer/judge separation is already enforced by the
  deterministic gate.
