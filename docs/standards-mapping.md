# Standards mapping — how USA compares to the state of the art

> _USA did not invent most of these checks. It reorganised them so one tool can

## Where USA differs from the field

### 1 · It is stage-aware; they are not

ASVS asks you to pick L1/L2/L3 _before_ you start [2](https://www.securecodinghub.com/blog/owasp-asvs-developers-complete-guide).
Scorecard gives an absolute 0–10. Neither asks "how old is this project, and does
that matter?"

USA detects the stage and dampens severity accordingly — while holding a hard floor
on CRITICAL. [maturity-profiles.md](maturity-profiles.md)

### 2 · It is agent-executable, not just human-readable

Every framework above is a document a human interprets. USA ships:

- `rules/` — machine-readable versions of the same checks
- a deterministic engine that settles ~70% of them
- a **judgement queue** that tells an agent or reviewer exactly what evidence to produce

That split is the whole design. An LLM should not be asked to grep for `eval(`; it
should be asked whether authorisation is enforced per resource.

### 3 · It separates "absent" from "wrong"

Every framework above has a checkbox. None distinguishes 🚫 MISSING from ⚠️ WRONG —
yet wrong is worse, because it looks finished. USA gives WRONG its own status, its
own check kind (`grep_wrong`), and a score of 0.15 rather than 0.00.

### 4 · It reports confidence alongside score

A 90/100 where only 40% of applicable rules could be verified is not a 90/100. USA
prints confidence next to every dimension and marks unverifiable sections
_"— not verified"_ instead of silently awarding 10/10.

### 5 · It is diffable

Every report embeds a machine-readable trailer so `usa diff` turns the next audit
into a progress report: fixed, regressed, newly applicable, net movement. None of the
frameworks above give you a first-class way to show you improved.

### 6 · It covers the AI era as a first-class section

S14 is mapped to the OWASP LLM Top 10 (2026) and the OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 (ASI, 2026) — including risks that did not exist when the other frameworks were written:
excessive agency, unbounded consumption, RAG tenant leakage, memory/context poisoning,
and the fact that `AGENTS.md` is executable-ish instruction that commits like code.

## Catalogue coverage

Every rule that draws from a codified standard carries a catalogue, pinned to the
exact version it was written against in [`rules/catalogues.yaml`](../rules/catalogues.yaml).
The catalogue is derived from the rule's `references:` — the first reference
matching a registered prefix wins — so the mapping cannot drift from the citations
that already justify it. This table is generated from the real loaded rules by
`usa standards`. "Fully automated" means the engine decides the rule on its own;
"assisted" means it needs `--allow-commands` or an external oracle artifact;
"manual" means a human owns the verdict. Rules with no codified standard behind
them (internal heuristics, tooling hints, or conceptual attributions) fall in the
`(uncatalogued)` bucket — an honest count, not an omission. <!-- usa:fact rules -->315<!-- /usa:fact --> rules total.

## Deliberate gaps

Things USA intentionally does **not** do. An audit tool that oversells is worse than
none.

| Not done                     | Why                                                | Do this instead                                               |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Penetration testing**      | No dynamic analysis, no fuzzing, no exploit chains | OWASP ASVS L2/L3 assessment, a pentest                        |
| **Deep SAST**                | Requires whole-program analysis                    | CodeQL, Semgrep, Snyk Code — USA checks they are _configured_ |
| **CVE lookup**               | Needs network + advisory databases                 | `npm audit`, `osv-scanner`, `trivy`, Dependabot               |
| **Compliance certification** | Only an accredited auditor certifies               | Use USA as the evidence checklist, then certify               |
| **Runtime/DAST**             | Nothing is executed                                | OWASP ZAP, Burp, your staging environment                     |
| **Formal verification**      | Out of scope for a checklist                       | Certora, Halmos, Kani                                         |
| **Org-level maturity**       | USA audits repositories                            | OWASP SAMM for programmes                                     |

### On Scorecard specifically

Scorecard is excellent and USA's S3/S8 borrow its shape. Two honest caveats, both
documented by its own users: it measures **process hygiene, not code quality**, and
peer-reviewed research found **no clean correlation** between high scores and fewer
vulnerabilities [1](https://rywalker.com/research/openssf-scorecard). Scorecard also
needs a public repo and network access. USA is the offline, code-level,
private-repo complement — run both.

### On SARIF

SARIF 2.1.0 is the right interchange format for static-analysis _results_, and most
SAST tools emit it. USA's primary artefact stays a prose-oriented, scored document
for humans and agents — but it now **emits** SARIF and JSON too
(`usa audit . --format sarif|json`, or infer the format from the `--out`
extension), and it can **ingest** an oracle's SARIF/JSON as evidence via the
`oracle` check kind. The internal finding model already carries file, line,
severity, and rule identity for every finding, so both directions are pure
projections. See [ADR-0018](adr/0018-json-and-sarif-renderers.md) and
[ADR-0019](adr/0019-oracle-evidence-ingestion.md).
