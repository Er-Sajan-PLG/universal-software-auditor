# Writing rule packs

A rule pack is one YAML file. Register it in `rules/index.yaml`, and USA decides at
audit time whether it applies.

```yaml
id: stacks/mobile
title: Mobile (iOS / Android / Cross-platform)
section: S15
section_title: Platform-Specific
description: 'Activated when iOS, Android, React Native, Expo, or Flutter is detected.'
version: '1.0'
skip_when: # skip the WHOLE pack when true
  all:
    - { fact: 'platform:mobile', op: 'absent' }
    - { fact: 'platform:ios', op: 'absent' }
    - { fact: 'platform:android', op: 'absent' }
provides: ['platform:mobile'] # facts this pack asserts
rules:
  - id: MOB-001
    title: Crash reporting is integrated
    section: S15
    section_title: Platform-Specific
    severity: HIGH
    class: operations
    applies_when: { fact: 'maturity:beta' } # optional per-rule gating
    depths: [standard, deep] # optional
    check:
      kind: grep_present
      pattern: '(Crashlytics|Sentry|BugSnag|Instabug)'
      include: ['**/*.{ts,tsx,js,json,plist,xml,gradle,swift,kt}']
      exclude: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/Pods/**']
      flags: i
    why: "On mobile you cannot watch the user's screen."
    evidence: 'Where tokens/PII live: Keychain/Keystore, not AsyncStorage.'
    remediation: 'Add Crashlytics or Sentry with dSYM upload.'
    references: ['OWASP-MASVS-STORAGE-2']
```

## Check kinds

### `manual` — needs a human or an agent

```yaml
check: { kind: manual }
```

Produces ❓ NEEDS REVIEW and lands in the judgement queue. Always pair with
`evidence:` — it is the prompt the reviewer works from.

### `file_exists` / `file_absent`

```yaml
check: { kind: file_exists, files: ['.gitignore'] }
check: { kind: file_absent, files: ['.env', '*.pem'] }
```

`file_absent` fails with locations when something is found. `file_exists`
accepts `non_empty: true` — an empty marker file (zero-byte `.gitignore`,
empty signature) counts as absent, because presence without content
proves nothing.

### `any_file`

```yaml
check:
  kind: any_file
  patterns: ['README.md', 'readme.md', 'README.rst']
```

### `any_of`

```yaml
check:
  kind: any_of
  checks:
    - kind: any_file
      patterns: ['codecov.yml']
    - kind: grep_present
      pattern: '\[tool\.coverage'
      include: ['pyproject.toml']
```

PASS when any sub-check passes (first PASS wins); otherwise the worst
outcome (FAIL > WRONG > MISSING). For concepts satisfied by alternatives
no single check expresses. Sub-checks parse through the same loader, so
every guard applies to them.

### `grep_present` / `grep_absent`

```yaml
check:
  kind: grep_present # PASS when found
  pattern: '(zod|joi|pydantic|class-validator)'
  include: ['**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,py,go}']
  exclude: ['**/*.test.*', '**/node_modules/**']
  flags: i # i = case-insensitive
```

`grep_absent` inverts it: any hit is a FAIL **with file:line locations** — this is
the workhorse for "no hardcoded secrets", "no `shell=True`", "no `http://`".

### `grep_wrong` / `grep_deprecated`

```yaml
check:
  kind: grep_wrong # hits → ⚠️ WRONG
  pattern: 'catch\s*\(\s*\w*\s*\)\s*\{\s*\}'

check:
  kind: grep_deprecated # hits → 💀 DEPRECATED
  pattern: 'new Buffer\s*\('
```

Use `grep_wrong` for "present but done incorrectly" — the status auditors most often
miss (Rule 9).

### `tracked_present` / `tracked_absent`

Asks **git** what is tracked, not what is on disk. Use for committed build output,
committed `.env`, committed model weights — anything whose presence in the working
tree is normal but whose presence in git is a bug.

```yaml
check:
  kind: tracked_absent
  patterns: ['dist/**', 'node_modules/**', '.env', '**/*.pt']
```

### `count_min`

```yaml
check:
  kind: count_min
  patterns: ['**/*.test.{ts,tsx}', '**/test_*.py']
  min: 5
```

### `file_lines_max`

```yaml
check:
  kind: file_lines_max
  patterns: ['src/**/*.ts']
  max_lines: 800
```

Any hit is ⚠️ WRONG with the line count. A cheap proxy for god objects.

### `json_path`

```yaml
check:
  kind: json_path
  file: 'package.json'
  path: 'engines.node'
  equals: '>=20'
```

`equals` omitted ⇒ PASS when the key is merely set. Works on JSON (JSONC tolerated).

### `command`

```yaml
check:
  kind: command
  run: '! npm audit --production --audit-level=high | grep -qiE "critical|high"'
  expect_exit: 0
```

**Skipped unless `--allow-commands`** — reported as ❓ NEEDS REVIEW otherwise.
USA never shells out without being asked.

### `oracle`

Ingests machine evidence an external scanner already produced (ADR-0011) and
asserts a numeric bound. Offline and read-only: it reads a _committed artifact_,
never a live probe, so it stays deterministic. It never re-derives the
scanner's findings — it consumes them as evidence, exactly the way ADR-0011
requires.

```yaml
# Count SARIF results (optionally filtered) and cap them.
check:
  kind: oracle
  source: sarif
  file: reports/codeql.sarif
  levels: [error] # optional: error | warning | note
  rules: ['sql-injection'] # optional: ruleId substrings
  op: at_most # optional: at_most (default) | at_least | equals
  value: 0
```

```yaml
# Read one number out of any JSON report.
check:
  kind: oracle
  source: json
  file: reports/coverage.json
  path: total.lines.pct
  op: at_least
  value: 80
```

Verdicts stay honest about provenance:

| Artifact state             | Status     | Why                                         |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| absent                     | 🚫 MISSING | No evidence is not a pass.                  |
| present, unparseable       | ❓ UNKNOWN | Fail closed (ADR-0009) — a human must look. |
| present, path not a number | ❓ UNKNOWN | Cannot assert a bound on a non-number.      |
| bound satisfied            | ✅ PASS    |                                             |
| bound violated             | 🔴 FAIL    |                                             |

`source: sarif` counts `runs[].results` across every run; a result with no
`level` counts as `warning`. `source: json` reads the dotted `path` with the
same resolver as `json_path`. Both `.sarif` and `.json` artifacts are read from
the audited tree and must be committed for the check to see them.

### Provenance verification

Release provenance answers "was this artifact built by us, from this source?"
(see `SUP-013` / `SUP-015` / `SUP-016` in
[supply-chain.yaml](../rules/core/supply-chain.yaml)). Two check kinds compose
into the full pattern, and both stay offline and deterministic.

**`command` — opt-in signature re-verification.** Re-verify with the project's
own tooling (typically `cosign verify-blob`). It runs only under
`usa audit . --allow-commands` — without the flag the rule reports
❓ NEEDS REVIEW instead of shelling out, and USA never shells out unasked.
When it does run, a missing binary fails the check: an artifact that cannot
be verified is never a pass (fail closed, ADR-0009).

```yaml
- id: SUP-0xx
  title: Release signatures verify against their cosign bundle
  section: S3
  section_title: Supply Chain & Build Provenance
  severity: HIGH
  class: supply-chain
  applies_when: { fact: 'maturity:production' }
  check:
    kind: command
    run: 'cosign verify-blob --bundle dist/app.bundle dist/app.tar.gz'
    expect_exit: 0
  remediation: 'Re-sign the release with cosign and commit the bundle beside the artifact.'
  references: ['SLSA-Build-L2']
```

**`oracle` — ingesting committed attestation evidence.** The release pipeline
writes the attestation; the rule only asserts a numeric bound over the
committed file, never a live probe. Split the bar by lifecycle via maturity
facts: at beta the attestation must exist; at production the recorded chain
must meet the bar. Both examples assume the pipeline writes a small numeric
summary (`statementCount`, `minBuildLevel`) beside the raw attestation — the
oracle reads numbers, not chains, so summarise the chain at emit time.

```yaml
- id: SUP-0xx
  title: Release carries provenance attestation
  section: S3
  section_title: Supply Chain & Build Provenance
  severity: LOW
  class: supply-chain
  applies_when: { fact: 'maturity:beta' }
  check:
    kind: oracle
    source: json
    file: attestations/provenance.json
    path: statementCount
    op: at_least
    value: 1
  remediation: 'Emit a SLSA provenance statement at release time and commit it under attestations/.'
  references: ['SLSA-Build-L2']
```

```yaml
- id: SUP-0yy
  title: Provenance chain meets the production bar
  section: S3
  section_title: Supply Chain & Build Provenance
  severity: HIGH
  class: supply-chain
  applies_when: { fact: 'maturity:production' }
  check:
    kind: oracle
    source: json
    file: attestations/provenance.json
    path: minBuildLevel
    op: at_least
    value: 2
  remediation: 'Build releases on a hosted builder that records SLSA provenance at the required level.'
  references: ['SLSA-Build-L2']
```

The artifact states stay honest: absent file → 🚫 MISSING, unparseable file
or non-numeric path → ❓ UNKNOWN (fail closed — a human looks), bound met →
✅ PASS, bound violated → 🔴 FAIL.

Cite `SLSA-*` references — the `slsa` catalogue is already pinned in
`rules/catalogues.yaml`. `cosign` and `sigstore` are tools, not codified
standards, so they take no catalogue entry (ADR-0021).

### `info`

Context only, never scored. Useful for explaining a section to a reader.

## Predicates

```yaml
applies_when: { fact: 'has:database' }

applies_when:
  any:
    - { fact: 'lang:typescript' }
    - { fact: 'lang:javascript' }

applies_when:
  all:
    - { fact: 'maturity:production' }
    - { not: { fact: 'project:library' } }

# Numeric facts use metric:
applies_when: { fact: 'metric:contributors', op: 'gt', value: 2 }
applies_when: { fact: 'metric:tags', op: 'exists' }
```

Operators: `exists` (default) · `absent` · `eq` · `neq` · `in` · `includes` · `gt` · `lt` · `matches`

Combinators: `all` · `any` · `not`

### Fail-closed contracts (the engine does not guess)

Malformed input warns at load time and evaluates conservatively — see
ADR-0009. What to know as an author:

- `in` / `includes` compare **metric** values against the list. On flag
  facts they are always false: presence alone never satisfies a value
  comparison.
- `matches` compiles `value` as a regex; an invalid regex warns and the
  predicate is false. Unknown operators and unknown predicate keys behave
  the same way (rule skipped, warning on stderr).
- An empty grep `pattern` drops the rule with a warning — `new RegExp('')`
  matches every line, so a missing pattern would otherwise FAIL (or PASS)
  the whole repo.
- Duplicate rule IDs across packs: first definition wins, later ones warn.
- Override `severity` must be on the ladder and `weight` a finite number
  ≥ 0, or the override is ignored with a warning. After editing a shipped
  pack, run `usa rules` and confirm it loads with **zero warnings** (the
  `tests/e2e.test.ts` suite enforces this for the in-tree packs).

## Style guide for rule authors

1. **Title = the desired state**, not the defect. "Tokens and sessions expire", not "Missing token expiry".
2. **`why` earns the rule its place.** If you cannot say why in one sentence, cut the rule.
3. **`remediation` must be actionable.** "Improve security" is not a fix. "Set `SameSite=Lax` and require a CSRF token" is.
4. **`evidence` is the deliverable for manual checks.** It tells the reviewer exactly what to produce.
5. **Exclude tests and docs from security greps.** A rule that fires on its own documentation is a rule people will disable.
6. **Prefer `grep_wrong` over `grep_absent`** when the _pattern_ is fine but a specific usage is not.
7. **Cite the standard.** `CWE-89`, `ASVS-5.3.4`, `SLSA-Build-L2`, `OWASP-LLM01:2026`.
8. **Severity = worst realistic outcome**, not typical. Dampening handles context; the rule should not.

## Testing your pack

```bash
usa rules --section S15        # did it load?
usa explain MOB-001            # did it parse as intended?
usa audit . --include stacks/mobile --depth deep
```

A pack with a YAML syntax error is skipped with a warning on stderr — the audit never
crashes because of a bad rule file.

## Starting from `usa bootstrap`

For a language with no shipped pack, `usa bootstrap <path> [--out <dir>]`
drafts a starter pack from the curated catalog (or generic judgement
prompts for unknown languages). The draft is a proposal, not a verdict —
see ADR-0012. The acceptance ritual before registering it in
`rules/index.yaml`:

1. Read every pattern; delete any that misfires on the target codebase.
2. Audit one project WITH the problem and one WITHOUT it; both runs must
   behave (`usa audit --rules-dir` accepts an unregistered pack dir, so
   the review never pollutes the shipped registry).
3. Add FP _and_ FN regression tests to `tests/integration/rules.test.ts`.
4. Register the reviewed file in `rules/index.yaml` and watch the
   self-audit-adjacent gates (`check-docs` rule floor, e2e uniqueness)
   stay green.
